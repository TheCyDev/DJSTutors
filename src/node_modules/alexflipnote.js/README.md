A simple AlexFlipnote API Wrapper

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/alexflipnote.js.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/alexflipnote.js/)

## Installation
```

## Tokens
Since AlexFlipnote recently added an Authorization feature to the API, ALL previous versions of this wrapper will no longer work and are considered to be deprecated!

Wondering how to get an Auth token to use your API ye? Well head on to https://discord.gg/DpxkY3x to request one.

## Typings
I added a typings file and will be working to perfect it. This allows editors like VSC to use intellisense/autocomplete to suggest functions and help out with parameters and to see what you'll be receiving as a result of function calls.

## Examples
### Await/Async example
```js
const client = require('alexflipnote.js');
const alexclient = new client('Your-API-Token-Here');

let link = await alexclient.image.cats();
let attachment = new Discord.MessageAttachment(link, "cat.png");
message.channel.send(attachment);

```

### Colorify Example
```js
const client = require('alexflipnote.js');
const alexclient = new client('Your-API-Token-Here');

let url = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/242263403001937920/37050aab01de8806e4bc1e2b83983439.webp?size=1024";

let link = await alexclient.image.colorify({image: url, c: "00ffd9", b: "000000"}));
let attachment = new Discord.MessageAttachment(link, "colorify.png");
message.channel.send(attachment);

```

### Color Example

const client = require('alexflipnote.js');
const alexclient = new client('Your-API-Token-Here');

returns:
